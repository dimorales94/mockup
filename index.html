				<h2>About</h2>
				<br>
				<h3>Fashion is not art. The aims of fashion and art are different and there is no need to compare them. </h3>
				<h4>â€“ Rei Kawakubo</h4>
				<br>
				<p> This is a website dedicated to edgy fashion inspired by cats.</p>
				<p>We encourage edge into personal style, we praise rebellion and non confoming fashion styles. Wear black leather, platform boots, faux fur jackets, leather collars, dye your hair with wild colors stand out from the rest of society. What society says about your fashion sense does not matter, if you feel good that is more than enough, work it. Our selection is inspired by punk, goth, lolita, grunge, avant garde, and japanese street fashion, we love to incorporate various sub catergories of fashion and there is something for everyone available. Our cat collection will always be available to everyone, all the proceeds from this collection will go to animal shelters throughout the US. There are many animals in need of food and shelter and our purpose is to help these creatures find a forever home. We also carry beauty supplies such as liquid lipstick, eyeshadow palletes, foundation and blush of course everything is not tested on animals, is cruelty free and all natural. </p>

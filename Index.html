			<h2>About</h2>

			<div class="separate">
				<p> This is a website dedicated to our cat overlords.

				<br>	
				<p>Cat /kat/ or Felis catus: a small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur, a short snout, and retractile claws. It is widely kept as a pet or for catching mice, and many breeds have been developed. That is the definition of a common housecat but space cats lead a far more adventurous life. Space cats live beyond the stars in distant galaxies beyond our comprehension; however we are aware of their existance. We recognize that there are more than a thousand breeds of space cats. These felines have far superior vision than humans and a heightened sense of smell which makes them very hard to catch. They are not feral, they have created their own civilizations and rule as a monarchy under the great queen cat. Space cats are bipedal because they have evolved into superior beings almost extra dimensional. If one is ever to encounter a space cat, one must treat the being with utmost respect due to their unpredictable behavior. We have yet to fully comprehend this species.</p>
